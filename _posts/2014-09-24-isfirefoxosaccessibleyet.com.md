Eitan from Mozilla's accessibility team was nice enough to reserve a [isfirefoxosaccessibleyet.com](http://isfirefoxosaccessibleyet.com) domain where we could track Firefox OS accessibility status easily and in the open. I am really happy to announce that [isfirefoxosaccessibleyet.com](http://isfirefoxosaccessibleyet.com) is now ready to be seen in public.

There are several bits of information about each app (including the overall system) that you can find there: an overall accessibility score, a number of opened, resolved and currently in progress bugs. We also provide links to the actual bug lists handy in case you need to dig deeper.

For anyone who wants to help out:

* If you are a user and want to file a bug, you should be able to find a link inside each app's section.
* If you are a developer and want to hack on *Gaia* accessibility, each app section has an up-to-date lists if high priority and good first bugs.

Please feel free to check it out!
